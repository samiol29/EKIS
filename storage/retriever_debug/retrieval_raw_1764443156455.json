How does the emergence of generative \nartificial intelligence (AI), based on large language models (LLMs), fit into the IR process?\nProcess: This perspective explores the use of generative AI in the context of the motivations, considerations, and outcomes of the IR process \nwith a focus on the academic use of such systems.\nConclusions: There are many information needs, from simple to complex, that motivat..."
